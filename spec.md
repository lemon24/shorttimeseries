Short Time Series
=================


Introduction
------------

Short Time Series (STS) aims to be a way of expressing time series that is
as easy to write as possible without being ambiguous.

STS allows varying degrees of precision and omitting redundant information.

STS is based on [RFC 3339][] / ISO 8601 where possible.

[rfc 3339]: http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt


Compatibility
-------------

This specification may be extended in the future if needed. All extensions
will be backwards-compatible.

[Semantic versioning](http://semver.org/) is used to track changes. The
current (first) version is 0.1. In accordance with the previous paragraph,
there will never be a 1.0 version.
